# Soup

Tierra with one instruction, where the CPU is a language model.

A grid of cells. Each occupied cell holds a Markdown genome. On a cell's turn the host
hands the model that genome as its instructions plus a one-line observation of the four
neighbours, and gives it a fixed slice of output tokens. The host then parses the output
for a single `WRITE` block and copies its body into the named neighbour, overwriting
whatever was there. That is the whole machine.

## Rules (v1)

- Grid is a torus. Neighbourhood is N/E/S/W.
- Two instructions, as JSON:

      {"action":"copy",  "dir":D}             copy this cell's genome into neighbour D
      {"action":"write", "dir":D, "text":T}   write the text T into neighbour D

  The instruction set is a JSON schema handed to the model as a grammar (constrained
  decoding), so every completion is a valid instruction: Tierra's property that every bit
  pattern is an opcode. Writing empty text empties the cell. One instruction per turn.
- **The slice is the price.** Each turn gets `maxTokens` of output. A `copy` costs a few
  tokens; a `write` costs its length, and one cut off by the slice is not an instruction.
  The genome's length is paid every turn as prompt, which phase 4 will meter.
- **Overwrite is the only death.** No reaper. A cell dies because a neighbour spent its
  slice writing over it. Nothing is free and nothing is decreed.
- **Mutation is host-applied noise on `copy`**, per character, at a rate you set: Tierra's
  cosmic rays. The copy instruction is hardware; the noise is physics. Temperature is a
  separate dial and governs behaviour, not heredity. (An earlier design made the model's
  own copy errors the only mutation; models under ~1B cannot echo a 100-token genome, so
  that stays an option for a larger model, not the floor.)
- **What the host tells a cell** is the same for every cell: its coordinates, the empty
  and occupied neighbours as two lists, and the instruction set with an example whose
  direction letters are rotated every turn so the example cannot anchor the choice.
- The scheduler sweeps all occupied cells in a random order, one cell per tick, then
  reshuffles. A cell written mid-sweep runs its new genome when its turn comes.

## Engines

- `mock`: no GPU. Behaves as a well-tuned ancestor should: copies into an empty
  neighbour; occasionally chatters instead.
  Exists to develop the loop without waiting on inference, and as the control for whether
  behaviour comes from the model or from the rules.
- `webllm`: a small instruct model over WebGPU, loaded in the page and cached by the
  browser. Qwen2.5-0.5B is the working floor; the status line shows which GPU it got.

## Run

`python serve.py` in this directory, then open http://localhost:8765/. It is a plain static
server that sends no-cache headers, so edits show up on reload without a hard refresh.
ES modules will not load from file://.

## Phases

1. Soup + mock engine. Done.
2. Real model via WebLLM, constrained decoding, host-side mutation. Done.
3. Neighbours' genomes become visible in the observation: the parasite threshold.
4. Explicit conservation: energy balances, inference debits, reproduction splits.
5. Instrumentation: lineage tree, genome length over time, diversity.
